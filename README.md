# Autumn's Rag Land

### Combining personal and professional in a React App

I taught myself how to sew in the summer of 2024 with youtube and a dream. Since then I've been self drafting clothes and accessories nearly every month. This page documents some of my favorite projects. I decided to focus on using secondhand fabric once I got the hang of basic techniques. I love the challenge of working with what I have and producing unique pieces.

I decided to showcase a few of my favorite projects as a kind of portfolio of my professional work. And as an excuse to spend my free time coding.
