# Personal Site

### Combining professional and personal

I'm currently open to work and decided to whip up a personal site using React. This single page application focuses on small components and simple styling. I even threw in a simple scroll animation. This site is technically for recruiters but I really just made it for fun. You might have seen the original sewing focused version (Autumn's Ragland). If that's the case, don't worry! I plan to flesh out the much smaller sewing section in the weeks to come. Thanks for checking out the site!
